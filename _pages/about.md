I am a postdoc researcher at [LIPhy](https://liphy.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en), Université Grenoble Alpes.

I'm a theoretical physicist working on **collective motion**, a theme included in the field of **active matter**. My approach involves both **analytical** and **numerical** work. I have developed different skills: coarse-graining of microscopic models, simulation of agent based models, simulation of hydrodynamic equations using pseudo-spectral methods, hydrodynamic simulations using finite element methods.

Currently, I'm working mainly on understanding the formation and cohesion of fish school.
