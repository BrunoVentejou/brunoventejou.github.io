excerpt: 'We investigate the susceptibility of long-range ordered phases of two-dimensional dry aligning active matter to population disorder, taken in the form of a distribution of intrinsic individual chiralities. Using a combination of particle-level models and hydrodynamic theories derived from them, we show that while in finite systems all ordered phases resist a finite amount of such chirality disorder, the homogeneous ones (polar flocks and active nematics) are unstable to any amount of disorder in the infinite-size limit. On the other hand, we find that the inhomogeneous solutions of the coexistence phase (bands) may resist a finite amount of chirality disorder even asymptotically.'
